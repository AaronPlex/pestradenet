# International Trade Networks
 In this code, we help to visualize international trade networks for the introduction potential of crop pathogens and pests.
 
For data about trade see (FAO)[https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TM], harvested area (FAO)[https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL], and pest status (CABI)[https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/59074053] at the national level. All datasets are publicly available.

For better visualization, we recommend to run this code using the Rmarkdown file attached above as we have already set plot size, font size and image resolution that fit well these visualizations.
