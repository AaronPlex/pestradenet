# International Trade Networks
 In this code, we help to visualize international trade networks for the introduction potential of crop pathogens and pests.
 
All datasets required for the analysis are publicly available at:
* [FAO](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TM) or [WTO](https://stats.wto.org/) for international trade,
* [FAO](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL) for harvested area, and
* [CABI](https://www.cabi.org/isc/datasheet/59074053) or your own built datasheet for pest distribution at the national level.

For better visualization, we recommend to run this code using the Rmarkdown file attached above as we have already set plot size, font size and image resolution that fit well these visualizations.
